# Introduction

Banks derive a significant portion of their profits from loans, but determining which applicants are most likely to repay their loans can be challenging. Manual loan application reviews can lead to misconceptions and errors, making it difficult to select genuine applicants.
This project aims to develop a loan prediction system using machine learning, allowing the system to automatically identify eligible candidates. This not only aids bank staff in making better decisions but also benefits applicants by reducing the time it takes to process loan approvals. In this project, we predict loan approval outcomes using several machine learning algorithms.

# AIM
The primary aim of this project is to predict which customers are likely to repay their loans. This is a supervised classification problem, which will be addressed using the following machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Linear SVM
- Boosting
- Bagging
